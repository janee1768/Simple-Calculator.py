⚙️ How It Works

User enters the first number.

Chooses an operation: +, -, *, /, or ^2.

If an operation requires two numbers, the user is prompted for the second number.

The result is displayed with proper handling of invalid inputs and division by zero.

💻 Example Run
Enter number: 10
Enter operation(+,-,*,/,^2): *
Enter 2nd number: 5
Answer: 50


Another run with squaring:

Enter number: 7
Enter operation(+,-,*,/,^2): ^2
Answer: 49

🛡 Error Handling

Prevents division by zero

Catches invalid operations and guides the user

🎯 Skills Demonstrated

Python fundamentals (loops, conditionals, operators)

Input handling & validation

Exception handling (ZeroDivisionError)

Writing clean, readable, and structured code

🔮 Future Improvements

Add support for power (^) and square root (√)

Implement a menu-driven interface instead of single input prompts

Extend to a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
