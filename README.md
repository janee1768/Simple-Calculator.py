Simple Calculator

This is a Simple Calculator built in Python. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two numbers and an operation as input from the user, then returns the result.

Features

Perform Addition (+)

Perform Subtraction (-)

Perform Multiplication (*)

Perform Division (/)

Handles invalid operations with an error message

How It Works

The program asks the user to input two numbers.

The user selects an operation (+, -, *, /).

The program calculates and displays the result.

If an invalid operator is entered, the program notifies the user.

Example Run
Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 5  
Enter operation(+,-,*,/): *  
Result: 50  

Technologies Used

Python 3

Future Improvements

Add support for more operations (e.g., modulus, power).

Improve error handling (e.g., division by zero).

Create a GUI version for better user experience.
