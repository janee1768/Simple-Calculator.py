### ðŸ“„ Description

The Simple Calculator is a command-line Python program that lets users perform a single arithmetic operation between two numbers. When the program starts, it asks the user to:

1. Enter the first number
2. Enter the second number
3. Choose an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`

Based on the operation selected:

* `+` adds the two numbers
* `-` subtracts the second number from the first
* `*` multiplies the numbers
* `/` divides the first number by the second

The result is then printed on the screen. If the user enters anything other than the four allowed symbols, the program shows **"Invalid operation"**.

This project helps beginners understand:

* How to take and convert user input
* How to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
* Performing basic math operations
* Error checking for invalid input

It's a simple yet useful exercise to build your programming basics in Python.
